# Learning Journal Made With Flask

Creating a local web interface of a learning journal. 

To run this application, please run the following command in bash:

```bash
$ python app.py
```

The main (index) page will list journal entry titles and dates. Each journal entry title will link to a detail page that displays the title, date, time spent, what you learned, and resources to remember. Then you are also able to add or edit journal entries. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed in a blog style website.
